        <h2>After the Rescue</h2>
        <p>
          After the rescue, Van An Nguyen worked at a refugee camp in Hong Kong.
          An was then sent to Denmark because his sister lived there. Two years
          later, in 1990, he could finally reunite with his wife and daughter,
          and in 1994, they became a family of six.

        <h3>Looking for Long-Lost Friend</h3>
        <p>
          When An fled Vietnam in 1988, he became close friends with Dung Ly
          amongst the boat people. But An lost contact with Dung in the 90s and
          hopes that sharing his story today will help him reconnect with his
          long-lost friend. The last An heard from Dung was that he had moved to
          Texas, USA, and below are photos that Dung had sent to An. If you have
          any information that might be helpful, please contact the Nguyen
          family via email or share this story.
